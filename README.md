In this case, we start with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). We start with exploring the data-types of all the features in the dataset, then we check if there are any missing values in the dataset. We further explore the categorical features in the dataset and perform feature transformation on them to make them compatible with the result of the numerical features. Next, we do feature selection using correlation analysis.Â¶ Next, we train a random forest classifier on the selected features to get a baseline model. We also explore the impact of feature normalization on the model.
